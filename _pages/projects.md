- This WHO TB Data Summary Page presents country profile data as reported in 2023 and 2024. Table 1 shows a 5-year trend of TB burden estimates, including TB incidence, HIV(+) TB incidence and mortality, and treatment coverage. Table 2 details the 5-year MDR/RR-TB burden estimate, including incidence numbers and percentages among new and previously treated cases. The report also features visualizations: a line graph illustrating the incidence of new and relapse TB cases, HIV-positive TB incidence (rate per 100,000 population per year) from 2010 to 2022, and a population pyramid showing the incidence of notified TB cases by age group and sex in 2022 (number). Given that the WHO updates global TB data and country profiles every October, this report provides a snapshot of Viet Nam's TB situation as default filtering, which would be useful for Vietnam TB control program to quickly refer to WHO estimates.
